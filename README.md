Local to local is setup, but transfering over network is not setup yet.

WARNING -- This does not check to see if a file of the same name already exists at the destinations path, therefore it will overwrite any existing files.

** Example command to run (no flags used)**
.\build_and_run.bat "C:\unzip-src" "C:\unzip-dest"
