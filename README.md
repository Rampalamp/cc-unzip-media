# cc-unzip-media

Local to local is setup, but transfering over network is not setup yet.

WARNING -- This tool does have a loose checking to see if a file stem exists at the destination path already, but I would not trust it fully...yet?

** Example command to run (no flags used)**
.\build_and_run.bat "C:\unzip-src" "C:\unzip-dest"
